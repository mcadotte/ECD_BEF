The code that performs the simulations from Cadotte & Tatsumi 2025 Ecology.
-LV_TwoSpp.R performs simulations using two-sepcies Lotka-Volterra models
-MCT_V2.R plots Chesson-type coexistence graph showing how altering parameters changes coexistence outcomes (this is the version in the publication).
-MCT.R also plots CHesson-type outcomes, but not one used to generate figures in the article
-Multi-species_BEF.R estimates ecosystem function (biomass) for multispecies assemblages.
